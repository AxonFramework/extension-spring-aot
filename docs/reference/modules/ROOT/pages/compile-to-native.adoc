:navtitle: Compiling to Native
= Compiling to Native

Before you set up this extension, it's important to read through the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html[documentation,window=_blank,role=external] from Spring itself. There are some known limitations that might require additional changes to the application. In addition, this extension needs to be added by adding the following dependency:


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>org.axonframework.extensions.spring-aot</groupId>
<artifactId>axon-spring-aot</artifactId>
<version>4.8.0</version>
</dependency>
----

This should be enough to have additional hints with ahead of time compilation to successfully build and run your Axon application.
